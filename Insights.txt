Insights

Females are most rightly skewed (more outliers in the high end) in the ring attributes
Males are most """Normally""" distributed but still slightly skewed to right

High overlap in male & female number of rings given their range are similar

Length also not determined by sex
length also insignificant in determining n rings(? maybe ?)
	- length itself is insignificant
if length is excluded, sex becomes more significant
	- because sex includes includes infants 

###
sex is poor variable in determining male female abalones and n rings alone
	- but is very useful in differentiating adults and infant abalones
###
Side note, using knn to determine exact n rings isn't a bad method, giving ~20% accuracy

Meaning
Using just Sex to estimate number of rings is bad idea
so basically sex likely can be not considered, but converted sex to 0 or 1
depending on I or M/F respectively

Good news! it predicts young abalone very well, ~91% accurate
Bad News! it predicts old abalone very poorly, ~39% accurate
